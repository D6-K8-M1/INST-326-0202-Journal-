Week 1

Used AI to clarify what the question was asking me to do and to explain what I did wrong once I attempted.
Explain concepts I didn't understand


Week 2

For some of the questions I was confused on how to get started and how to approach, so I asked AI to explain what I need to do
and with its guidance I was able to write the code. If I got it wrong, then I asked to explain what I did wrong then went 
back to fix it


Week 3

I was confused on how to go about the questions so I asked AI to give me steps on how to go about the problem. I attempeted it and if I got it wrong
I pasted my code to see what went wrong and asked it to explain what and how to fix it and I tried again until I got it. When I was done I pasted the code
and checked if it was right and had it give me suggestions on how to improve.
